### Portfolio
This repo holds the files for my updated portfolio that not only showcases the projects that I've worked on and have completed during my studies at the University of California San Diego Extension Boot Camp through Trilogy Education Services. Unlike the previous portfolios that I built as part of my boot camp, this new portfolio incorporates more of the technologies that I've been learning. 

## Technologies Used
This portfolio incorporates the following technologies:

* HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* Bootstrap, Google CDN, cdnjs, and a few other readily avaible CDNs
* Node.js
* Progressive Web Application Technology
* React

## Project Team Members
All of the apps showcased in this portfolio, with the exception of the apps "Talk Geeky To Me" and "Scrawl" were individual projects. "Talk Geeky To Me (Project 1)" and "Scrawl (Project 2)" were team based projects that could have never been accomplished without the help of my wonderfully talented classmates and team members Cara, Art, and Collin. You can find their repositories here:

Cara (Projects 1 and 2): https://github.com/carabunnell/
Art (Projects 1 and 2): https://github.com/steppenbar
